## Introduction

Federated Learning is an innovative machine learning approach designed to train models across decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples. Unlike traditional centralized machine learning, where data is collected and processed in a central server, Federated Learning enables model training directly on edge devices or local servers while keeping data localized and private.

In Federated Learning, the training process occurs collaboratively across multiple devices or nodes without the need to share raw data. Instead, only model updates or aggregated information is exchanged between the central server and individual devices. This decentralized approach addresses privacy concerns, as sensitive data remains on the user's device, reducing the risk of data breaches.

The process involves the following key steps:

* Initialization: The central model is initialized, typically with random parameters.

* Local Training: Each device independently trains the model using its local data. The model remains on the device throughout this phase.

* Model Update: After local training, only the model updates (gradients or weights) are sent to the central server.

* Aggregation: The central server aggregates the received updates from all participating devices, adjusting the global model accordingly.

* Iteration: Steps 2-4 are repeated iteratively to refine the model based on the collective knowledge of all participating devices.

Federated Learning offers several advantages, including privacy preservation, reduced communication overhead, and the ability to adapt models to diverse datasets without centralizing sensitive information. It has applications in various fields, such as healthcare, finance, and Internet of Things (IoT), where preserving data privacy is paramount.
